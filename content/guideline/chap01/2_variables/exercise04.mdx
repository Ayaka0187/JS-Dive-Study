# 🐚 Section 4: Lifecycle of Variables - Execution Context & Hoisting
#### 🏁 Learning Goal:
Understand how JavaScript processes variables **from declaration to execution** and how hoisting affects them.

<br />

## 4.1. How JavaScript Processes Variables 🌱
JavaScript handles variables in **three phases**:

1. **Declaration Phase** → Memory is allocated.
2. **Initialization Phase** → `var` is initialized to `undefined`, while `let` & `const` remain uninitialized.
3. **Assignment Phase** → The actual value is assigned.

---

### **🔧 Task 1: Variable Lifecycle in Action**
Predict what will happen when running the following code.

```javascript
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

var a = "I am var";
let b = "I am let";
const c = "I am const";

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
```

#### **🔎 Questions**
1. What will be printed in the first three `console.log` calls?
2. Will any error occur? If yes, where and why?
3. What happens when using `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of hoisting?
4. How does JavaScript handle variables before they are assigned?

## 4.2. Understanding Hoisting 🎣
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of **moving variable declarations to the top of their scope before execution**.

However, there’s a difference in **how `var`, `let`, and `const` are hoisted**:

| Keyword  | Hoisted? | Initialized? | Can be accessed before assignment? |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `var`    | ✅ Yes  | ✅ `undefined` | ✅ Yes |
| `let`    | ✅ Yes  | ❌ Uninitialized (Temporal Dead Zone) | ❌ No (ReferenceError) |
| `const`  | ✅ Yes  | ❌ Uninitialized (Temporal Dead Zone) | ❌ No (ReferenceError) |

---

### **🔧 Task 2: Observing Hoisting Effects**
```javascript
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(z);

var x = "var variable";
let y = "let variable";
const z = "const variable";
```

#### **🔎 Questions**
1. What will be printed, and where will errors occur?
2. Why does `var` behave differently from `let` and `const`?
3. What is the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, and how does it affect `let` and `const`?

---

## 4.3. Special Case: Function Hoisting 🏗️
Functions declared with `function` are **hoisted differently** compared to `var`, `let`, and `const`.

```javascript
greet();

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHi();

const sayHi = function() {
    console.log("Hi!");
};
```

#### **🔎 Questions**
1. Why does `greet()` work before its declaration?
2. Why does `sayHi()` cause an error?
3. How does function hoisting differ from variable hoisting?

<br />

## 🌟 Summary
- **Variable Lifecycle**: Declaration → Initialization → Assignment.
- **Hoisting** moves declarations to the top but initializes `var` with `undefined`, while `let` and `const` remain **uninitialized** (TDZ).
- **Functions** declared with `function` are fully hoisted, but function expressions (`const sayHi = function() {}`) follow variable hoisting rules.
