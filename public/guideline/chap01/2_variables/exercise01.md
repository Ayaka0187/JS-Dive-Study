# 🐚 Section 1: The Need for Variables
#### 🏁 Learning Goal:
Recognize the need for variables in dynamic logic, maintainability, and code optimization.

## Eliminating Hardcoded Repetition: Ride Fare System 🚖
### 🔍 Task 1: Identify the Problem
Here is a **ride-hailing app**. <br/>
Currently, the base fare is $5, and the cost per mile is $2.

```javascript
console.log("Fare for 3 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 3));
console.log("Fare for 7 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 7));
console.log("Fare for 10 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 10));
console.log("Fare for 4 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 4));
console.log("Fare for 2 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 2));
console.log("Fare for 14 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 14));
console.log("Fare for 10 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 10));
console.log("Fare for 6 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 6));
console.log("Fare for 7 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 7));
console.log("Fare for 21 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 21));
console.log("Fare for 9 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 9));
console.log("Fare for 18 miles: $" + (5 + 2 * 18));
```
The company decided to update pricing:
- Base fare is now $7 (instead of $5).
- Cost per mile is now $2.5 (instead of $2).

**Modify the code above to reflect these changes.**

```javascript
    // Your code here
```

- **What's the problem?**
    - _Identify **at least two issues** with the hardcoded approach_
    - _Explain **why this is inefficient** and **what problems it might cause** in future updates._
    - _Delete these italic instructions and write in your own words here_

<br />

### 🔧 Task 2: Use Variables to Optimize the Logic
- **Use variables** to store `baseFare` and `costPerMile` to avoid repeating values.
- **Make the system flexible** so future price changes only require one update
    ```javascript
        // Your code here
    ```
- **What benefits do variables bring here?**
    - _Write your thoughts here._
